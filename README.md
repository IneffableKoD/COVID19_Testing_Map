## Short Description

There is no map displaying the facilities that offer COVID-19 tests. COVID-19 Testing Facilities Map is an attempt to create a map where those facilities can be mapped. The map serves two purposes:

1. Information for consumers
2. Planning tool for establishing new facilities

## Team 

CEVEN.hack is a hackathon team by CEVEN Decentralized GeoTech. 

## Story

COVID-19 tests are hard to run. There is a lack of test-sets and a lack of organization. The flow of those that are supposed to get tested is hard to organize, congestion of people waiting to be tested can lead to unnecessary exposure/risk of infection.

A map displaying the testing facilities helps to plan and organize the testing facilities. 

## Design / Development

The COVID-19 Testing Facilities Map uses Leaflet with OSM tiles. Everything is built on open-source, readily available, and easy to manipulate software/code.

## Whats Next?

- Find capable collaborators
- Enter more data on testing facilities
- See "TO-DO"
